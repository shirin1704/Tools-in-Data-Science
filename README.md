# Tools-in-Data-Science

The IIT Madras BS Degree in Data Science and Programming has a course in its Diploma Level called Tools in Data Science.
This repo includes all the efforts that I have put into attempting to pass this course, coz phew it's a challenge.

This is the documentation of the course that includes all the course contents, as well as the assignment descriptions : https://tds.s-anand.net/#/
(It can always be accessed, but it's updated at regular intervals, so if my answers don't match the questions, they did at one point. I promise.)
